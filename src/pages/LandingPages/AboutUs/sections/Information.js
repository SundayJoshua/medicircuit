                    Every year, Africa imports over USD 4 billion worth of medical devices a
                    staggering figure that highlights both the demand for healthcare innovation and
                    the continent’s heavy reliance on foreign technology. At MediCircuit, we see
                    this as both a challenge and an opportunity.
